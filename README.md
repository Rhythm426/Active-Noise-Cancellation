##  Active-Noise-Cancellation
A study of various LMS Algorithms like FxLMS, FuLMS and Bilinear FxLMS in MATLAB.

**LMS(Least Mean Squared):** The basic Active Noise Control algorithm.

**FxLMS(Filtered-X Least Mean Squared):** In this, an additional filter is added in the secondary path signal. The weights of the filter is updated using a single variable.

**FuLMS(Filtered-U Least Mean Squared):** In this, an additional filter is added in the secondary path signal. The weights of the filter is updated using two variables.

**Bilinear FxLMS(Filtered-U Least Mean Squared):** In this, an additional filter is added in the secondary path signal. The weights of the filter is updated using three variables.
